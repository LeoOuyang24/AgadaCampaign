    Arden's Anchor was a small fishing village at the time of the Reckoning. In a matter of days, its small population more than tripled as it took 
    upon hundreds and hundreds of refugees from the west wing of Anachreon. Since then, Arden's Anchor has ballooned into the 2nd largest kingdom
    on the continent, just behind Goldwall. Ruled by the Dakata family since the Reckoning, it now controls virtually the entire east coast with 
    its powerful navy. <br/><br/>
    While merchants and adventurers laud the royal family for its relatively lax laws and "hands-off" approach to governing, others criticize the kingdom
    for its lack of attention to its citizens and greater interest in conquest. Since taking on so many of Anachreon's former citizens, the Dakata family
    has set their sights on being the next Anachreon, an ambitious plan that would see them become the next continent-wide power. They already have
    nearly perfect influence across East Agada but the military presence and position of Goldwall, has deterred them from expanding further, for now.

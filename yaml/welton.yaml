    Welton has a double-edged reputation: on one hand, its ancient lighthouse provides valuable relief for sailors stuck in the perilous waves of 
    Cape Welton. On the other hand, its dense fog, quiet atmosphere, and soft-speaking residents all contribute to the town's abandoned, 
    "corpse-like" vibe. 
    And with the Bladed Mountains to the North and the ravenous waves of Cape Welton to the South, Welton is perhaps the only settlement
    more isolated than Goldwall. It has only ever been reached by boat, though a land route is hypothetically possible if done by 
    experienced adventurers.<br/><br/>
    Originally established by Anachreon as a port city that connects the west with the east, it was left 
    completely forgotten for nearly a century after the Reckoning. Even when trade between west and east coasts was reestablished,
    the famous lighthouse remained dormant for several decades before mysteriously turning on one winter evening.
    The first returning sailors described finding a decrepit town that seemed to 
    move in "slow motion", as if forever stuck in the past. Since then, rumours have spread of unspeakable horrors lurking in the waves and of the 
    legendary "Ship's Bane", a mighty leviathan that lures and devours entire ships by mimicking the light of the Welton lighthouse.<br/><br/>
    Today Welton's valuable location and superstitious reputation means that it is simultaneously the last place sailors want to stop at, as well
    as their main lifeline should they be caught in the storms of Cape Welton. Younger sailors either try to avoid it entirely 
    or purposely seek it out for thrills. Older, more experienced sailors scoff at the strange tales regarding the village, 
    though even they tend to keep their visits short.

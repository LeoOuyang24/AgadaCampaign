    One of the youngest establishments of Agada is Edgar's Crossing, a small military base where Goldwall stations soldiers in an attempt to 
    deter any western invasions from Arden's Anchor. Its strategic location effectively blocks off naval invasions past Welton while also barricading
    land-invasions crossing the Great Chasm. This same location means adventurers will occasionally stop by hoping for a rest stop before treasure
    hunting in the ruins of Anachreon but these requests are almost universally rejected.

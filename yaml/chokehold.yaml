    Long before its fancy buildings, Academy of Magic, and imprisoned demon lord, long before even the first walls of Anachreon were built,
    there stood the Chokehold, a narrow, 3 mile wide coastal cliffside that all but ensures that Goldwall is nearly impervious to invasion by land.
    Besides the natural incline of the cliffside, the ferocious waves underneath devour all but the sturdiest ships. Even the land itself is not safe
    ; coastal druids familiar with the area believe that in time, the land will be completely eroded, completely isolating the peninsula and its 
    future inhabitants from the rest of the continent.<br/><br/>

    For now, the cliffside stands as a symbol of Goldwall's power and stability, a unifying sight for anyone passing in or out of the kingdom's reach,
    as well as its isolation from the rest of the continent.

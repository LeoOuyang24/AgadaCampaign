    In their conquest of the continent, the Anachreons came into conflict with the Qithin, a tribe of nomadic dragonborn that claimed the Anachreon mesa
    as their ancestral home. As Anachreon expanded, the Qithin were pushed out and ultimately forced to live in the southwestern corner of the
    continent. Here they dealt with brutal summers, infertile lands, and the demise of their nomadic lifestyles. <br/><br/> 
    The fall of Anachreon and the rise of Arden's Anchor has led not to the reinstatement of the Qithin, but rather their reintegration. 
    The Qithin are now considered rightful citizens of Arden's Anchor, leading to their mass immigration to the capital and the subsequent 
    death of their Anachreon-era villages in the Southwest. The Crossroads remains the one exception due to its unique location that 
    positions it right in the middle of affairs in the western sector. "All goes through the Crossroads" is a common saying at Arden's Anchor, with
    nearly every major road crossing through the village. <br/><br/>
    Despite its constant bustling traffic, the population at the Crossroads has remained small, likely due to the high heat of the mesa deterring
    any potential migrants. Thus, almost the entire long-term population of the Crossroads is of Qithin descent, providing one of the few 
    remaining bastions of ancestral Qithin culture.

    For its primarily tiefling population, Fool's Edge stands for prosperity, wealth, and hard work. Originally a colony composed of many of society's 
    least wanted, it is now a thriving harbor town. Its location within the Grand Marsh, situated between Cape Welton and Goldwall, offers a valuable 
    pit stop between two of the most dangerous areas to sail through.

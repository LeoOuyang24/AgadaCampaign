    The ultimate reminder of the last Anachreon king's folly is the Great Chasm, a roughly 30 mile wild chasm that separate East Agada from West Agada.
    Created by the sheer force of Palabra's arrival, it's a miracle that there is any remaining of Anachreon's kingdom. Accounts from that day tell 
    of a massive portal, as wide as the continent, cutting through the stone, from which legions of demons poured out. <br/><br/>
    Today, the chasm's roaring waters and annoying logistical issues it provides for traders, seem small in comparison to the once life threatening
    invasion of Palabra. However, its splitting of the continent in two means that should a continent-wide war/calamity occur, it will likely 
    be a major hotspot for conflict once more. <br/><br/>
    For most of its visitors, the most common way to cross the Great Chasm is the Alliance Bridge, a large bridge built with the cooperation of 
    Goldwall and Arden's Anchor in a symbolic, friendly gesture. A gesture that some have gloomily noted will be instantly shattered should war 
    break out, as control of the bridge will instantly become one of the hottest spots of war. Other methods of crossing the chasm include sailing around it
    and portal services offered by wizards for those willing to pay.

    The primarily elven population of Tarindis is thought to be descended from a proud elven race that once lived high up in the Stoneteeth Mountains. 
    Legend has it they had the finest mages in the land, so powerful they learned to summon and dismiss blizzards at will. Ultimately, their power
    was their greatest downfall, with differing myths telling different stories: some say a traitor king grew corrupt with power, others tell of
    angry gods punishing the elves for their hubris. <br/><br/>
    Whatever happened, today Tarindis stands as the last reasonably weathered settlement before the brutal, year-round winters of the Stoneteeth
    Mountains. It is a common stopping point for ambitious hikers to grab a final warm bite as well as a place for traders to sell and barter goods 
    only found in the mountains. Yeti fur, Remorhaz spines, White Dragon Scales, rumor has it some even carry the legendary Mostac bark.

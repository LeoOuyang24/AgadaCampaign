    For generations, the Bluewald Falls fed fresh water into the town of the same name, steadily fueling its population growth. At 
    the time of the Reckoning, Bluewald was the largest settlement on the east, well on its way to becoming a small town and a potentially
    important area of trade for the Anachreon empire. No one of course, could've predicted the rapid population growth of Arden's Anchor, which eclipsed
    Bluewald in a matter of days. <br/><br/>
    Today it plays second fiddle to its larger cousin, a democratically elected mayorship to a massive monarchy.
    Points of interest include the gold panning museum and the large kraken fruit farms exclusive to Bluewald and its mountains.

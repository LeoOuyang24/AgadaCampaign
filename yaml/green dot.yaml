    Shortly after the Reckoning, the remaining Sage Six separated. Sadhi Baresh sought out her family at Aksh-Bakar.
    Danis P sailed off the coast of what is now Southport, swearing to spend the rest of his life at sea. Valmar Vish headed back west 
    to an unknown fate.
    The remaining three stayed behind to build what is now Goldwall. A year into the project, Mafis Glenn disappeared under mysterious 
    circumstances after a long night at the bar. After 5 years, Trysta Batar left the now functioning town of Goldwall to rejoin her family at 
    Bluewald. Catalus Mroot, the last remaining member, stayed in Goldwall for the next decade before disappearing one night.
    A witness claims he was seen heading onto a ship on the northern harbor. A single note left behind states that he has left for the "Green Dot".
    <br/><br/>
    The Green Dot is a mysterious island that was incredibly close to the peninsula of Goldwall when the Sage Six and the remaining Anachreon 
    army first arrived; historical records attest it was a mere 5 miles off shore. Given the state of the world at the time, no one expressed
    any interest in investigating it further. It was given its nickname and quickly forgotten. <br/><br/>
    During the building of Goldwall, builders noted the island rapidly drifting away from the peninsula at a rate unexplainable by
    geological mechanisms. Catalus Mroot led the first expedition to the island, which returned claiming nothing unusual. One member did not return,
    apparently having fallen overboard during a storm. Catalus returned one more time by himself, a year before his eventual disappearance. When 
    he left, the Green Dot was estimated to be roughly 30 miles off shore. <br/><br/>
    Since that time, the whereabouts of Catalus and the Dot are unknown. The location provided on the map is its last known location
    and the provided drawing is a sketch done by a long-dead soldier of Anachreon.

    Stretching a little over 30 miles long and 60 feet wide, the Alliance Bridge is one of the grandest construction projects of recent times. Built 
    with the cooperation of Arden's Anchor and Goldwall, the bridge stands as a metaphorical and literal connection between the two kingdoms. This 
    extends even to the bridge's breaking: with foundations deeply rooted in the heavy rocks of the seabed below, experts estimate that should the 
    bridge ever fall, it'll almost certainly be due to outside intervention and thus the literal and metaphorical fall of relations between the West 
    and East. <br/><br/>
    For now the bridge stands, where it serves as not only the most common crossing point over the Great Chasm, but an important trading point in 
    its own right as many traders have set up shop along its edge. Travelers can often find coastal treasures without having to travel the 
    entire way to the coast as well as mesa or ocean-specific items found only in the bridge's local area.

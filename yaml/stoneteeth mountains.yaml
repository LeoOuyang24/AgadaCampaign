    The mighty Stoneteeth Mountains stand like gatekeepers to the desolate north, the last truly remote area of Agada. Even under mighty Anachreon, 
    adventurers found better uses of their time, than risking their lives in the jagged, freezing mountains of the north. <br/><br/>
    But adversity grows the sweetest fruit. The few survivors to breach the mountains tell of mighty creatures and natural resources
    found nowhere else. Yeti fur is the warmest material one can find and white dragon scales produce arrows of irreplicable quality. The gemstones
    of the north grow fat under sheets of ice and rock, with lucky miners selling them for thousands of gold pieces. Yet the most valuable resource
    of the north is the legendary Mostac bark, which grows on the hardy Mostac tree, one of the few plants to adapt to the harsh environment of the north.
    <br/><br/>
    What makes the Mostac bark so difficult to harvest is not its rarity or even its environment, but rather the Stoneteeth people. Known as 
    Mol'al (winter's chosen) in their native tongue, the orcs of the north rever Mostac trees from which they craft their shields, staves, weapons,
    and even their medicine. Though usually peaceful, Mol'al orcs viciously defend the trees from outsiders, their fighting prowess and natural 
    toughness honed by generations in the brutal mountains. Thus, in the markets of Tarindis and beyond, even white dragon scales appear more often than Mostac bark. And when it does appear, it yields for prices
    enough to sustain a lifetime. After all, harvesting it could easily cost a life.

    Agada's closest neighbor is the island of Hashasa, a mere 30 miles from Southport. Reports of the island have existed since the Anachreon days,
    which describe a lush jungle home to ancient and massive reptiles, now called "dinosaurs", not found anywhere else. 
    The island quickly drew the attention of hunters and adventurers throughout Anachreon; the remains of some of their common gathering points 
    can still be found today. <br/><br/>
    As fun as Hashasa could be, it was a dangerous place first and foremost. The commonly sought after quarry, hydras, allosaurs, and the mighty 
    tyrannids, were all fierce fighters known to take down entire settlements. The most brutal of the tyrannids developed legendary names and 
    were sought after by some of the bravest (and most foolish) hunters. The danger only increased in the southern regions of the island, 
    where the jungles thickened. Rumors tell of carnivorous plants, the largest dinosaurs of the island, and even a long dead civilization
    in the southern reaches. <br/><br/>
    Today, Hashasa access is even more limited than before. There is no publicly available sea route; the most common access points are through 
    the Hunters Lodge, which sometimes sponsors trips, or through privately owned ships owned by the rich and priviledged. Of course, people year 
    round still find ways onto the island, seeking adventure.

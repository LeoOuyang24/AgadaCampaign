    For the longest time, the peninsula on the far east of the continent of Agada was uninhabited, uninteresting, and unreachable.
    Why bother with the lands of the distant east, when the lands east and center were rich with resources and brimming with adventure?
    Besides, the horrible storms surrounding the peninsula ensure that reaching it by sea was virtually unviable, while it was too far
    to be reached by land.
    <br/><br/>
    It wasn't until the dreaded year of 582, the year of the Reckoning, that the peninsula's value was fully appreciated.
    The arrival of Palabra and his demonic forces, split the continent in two and forced the Sage Seven to flee their centuries-old
    headquarters in Anachreon. They had no choice but to flee all the way to the east, where the same horrible storms that had made the peninsula
    impenetrable for so many centuries, also made it difficult for the demons to invade. Defeating Palabra, however, was another matter,
    and with the infamous defect of the seventh member, the remaining six were forced to imprision Palabra, instead of killing him entirely.
    His imprisoned body, forever immobilized, remains even now in what is now the esteemed Magic Quarter of the kingdom of Goldwall.
    <br/><br/>
    In the centuries since, Goldwall has grown enormously, fueled by its rich natural resources and incredibly safe location. It is the largest
    civilization of Agada, even beating out Arden's Anchor, and only surpassed by the long-extinct, ancient kingdom of Anachreon.
    <br/>
    The Trade, Royal, and War Quarters of Goldwall are certainly impressive. But by far its biggest claim to fame is the Academy of Magic,
    the finest school of magic in the world, centered in the decorated Magic Quarter, where the immobilized Palabra still stands today.

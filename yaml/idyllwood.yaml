    The peaceful village of Idyllwood, the name of which also often refers to the surrounding forest, serves as a quiet backdrop to the bustling
    business of Goldwall. Though separate from the main city-state, it is considered a part of the kingdom; in fact many of the kingdom's 
    most important veterans retire here. As a result, it has gained a reputation for being an "old person's town". <br/><br/>
    However, in recent years that has begun to change. The increase in popularity of owlbear hunting has led many young adventurers and hunters to 
    the surrounding forests, much to the annoyance of the older population. But with the rising demand and prices for owlbear claw daggers, that 
    trend seems unlikely to change soon.

 name: "Grand Marsh"
 type: "Point of Interest"
 text: >
    The massive wetlands in the eastern region of Agada are among the most misunderstood areas of the continent. What is known is that it is absolutely 
    brimming with life, fueled by fresh ice water from the Stoneteeth Mountains. Creatures and monstrosities large and small, dangerous and tame,
    call the marsh home. The swamp is also the ancestral lands of the Yin-arg, a spiritual tribe of goblins. <br/><br/>
    The most well-traversed path through the marsh, the Grand Marsh Trail, is the most direct path from civilization to civilization, through the marsh.
    However, the sludgy and unpredictable flooding of the area, as well as the life forms, often mean travel can be difficult even for prepared 
    adventurers. And though they typically keep to themselves, the Yin-arg are known to pick off weak stragglers, should they find the opportunity.

 name: "Anachreon"
 type: "Dead Kingdom"

    At one point a continent-wide empire, Anachreon was, and arguably still is, the most influential kingdom on the continent of Agada. Its influence 
    can be felt in modern politics, modern geography, and even the current time scale. <br/><br/>
    Little is known about Agada's primordial history, except that it was once populated by several squabbling city-states. 
    A now nameless king united the most powerful among them in a blistering military campaign now only told through the lens of legend and 
    ultimately declared himself God-Emperor. He named his empire "Anachreon", meaning "eternal state", and literally rewrote time by
    proclaiming the empire's foundation to be year 0. <br/><br/>
    For nearly 6 centuries, Anachreon stood as the metaphorical and literal center of Agada. It controlled all trade, had the strongest army
    by virtue of having the only permitted army, and even established minor relations with distant island peoples. But Anachreon's greatest might
    was undoubtedly its advances in the arcane. With extensive trade routes feeding the kingdom's every need, people of the capital were able to
    engage in crafts not necessary to trade nor survival. At its height, it is estimated a whopping 80% of the population knew minor magic, and a
    ridiculous 30% knowing high magic, creating the world's first and so far only magocracy. At the top was the Sage Seven, a respected council of 
    seven magic users who each specialized in a school of magic, with the exception of necromancy due to its taboo nature. They were easily the most
    poweful magic wielders of their times and perhaps of all times.<br/><br/>
    But the only thing more famous than the life of Anachreon, is its death. The 60th king of Anachreon sought 10th level magic, a prospect 
    which was hypothetically possible but remained frustratingly just outside the grasp of mortal minds. The king sought help from a demon known 
    as Palabra, who offered the king assistance in casting a powerful spell that would supposedly stop his aging. Upon casting it, however, 
    the king unleashed a massive portal which split the continent in two. From that continent Palabra and his forces spilled out to conquer Agada for 
    itself. <br/><br/>
    With the capital falling within days, the Sage Seven fled to the east with a small surviving army, ultimately making a successful defense at what 
    would become Goldwall. The final hours of the event are muddled but they all revolve around the betrayal from the seventh member.
    The most popular telling tells of Palabra successfully breaching the defenses thanks to said betrayal. 
    Others say that the seventh member was the 60th king, and his betrayal was in unleashing Palabra upon the realm. Whatever happened, 
    by the time Palabra reached the Sage Seven, they only had six members and without the seventh, they were only able to contain Palabra, not kill him. 
    <br/><br/>
    The betrayal of the seventh member is perhaps as infamous as the entire empire of Anachreon itself. It was and is considered an act so disgraceful
    its name has been completely wiped from the history books, nearly completely lost to the sands of time. The one exception to this rule is the remaining
    surviving Sage Seven member, Catalus Mroot, a dwarven druid that retired to the Green Dot, shortly after the Reckoning. <br/><br/>
    As for Anachreon itself, its ruined remains serve as a grim reminder of the limits of mortal power and the ways it can be abused. To this day,
    leftover demons from Palabra's army haunt the ancient walls ensuring that the land will be uninhabitable for years to come.<br/><br/>
    But the biggest threat
    is ironically one of the last working remnants of the Anachreon empire: large Cadaver Collectors, massive constructs that were once the premier 
    war machines of the Anachreon army. Programmed to operate until given new orders and built to last forever, the Collectors stalk the Dragon's Maw 
    Mesa, cutting down would-be trespassers, and following orders from masters long since dead from a land long since abandoned.

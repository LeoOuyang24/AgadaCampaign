    The former military post of once glorious Anachreon is one of the few standing settlements of the ancient kingdom. At the time of the Reckoning, 
    it was home to some  500 military families. Its strategic location next to the Big Twin river and close proximity to the Small Twin river, 
    gave Anachreon unparalleled control over two of Agada's most important natural resources. After the fall of Anachreon, many of the families left, 
    but enough remained to sustain a small village population. Today Aksh-Bakar's location along the rivers means it sees a fair amount of visitors 
    hough few of them choose to stay.

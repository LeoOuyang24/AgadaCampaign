    One of the most common sights for travelers to and from Goldwall is Cornhill, a quiet village known for corn, wheat, bees, and various other crops.
    This and its location makes it a valuable trading partner for Goldwall as well as many surrounding
    settlements, who lack the fertile land that has kept Cornhill rich for generations.

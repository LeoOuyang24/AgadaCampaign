    The Emerald Mountains and the Emerald Lake have long been an area of tranquility in the bustling Goldwall Peninsula. Even the legendary 
    Catalus Mroot was said to frequent the place as a vacation spot when constructing the city of Goldwall, drawn the evergreen 
    mountains, clear skies, and vibrant plant life. Soon however, adventurers discovered the mountains' biggest gem: the stone-sky grapes. 
    Large, sour and slightly sweet, the grapes barely drew any attention aside from being a very tart snack, until fermented. In a matter of months,
    "Emerald wine" is said to have singlehandedly built the now modern Emerald Village, a farming village known for its viticulture. The wine is 
    obviously the main export, but the crisp cool temperatures and fresh air of the mountains means that the Emerald Village is also known for its 
    perry, cider, and mead.

    Northern Grasp was once a dwarven mining town, with prospectors flocking to the area to look for gold in the nearby mountains. With gold fever
    now having been over for decades, the village is home to many dwarves that reminisce about the old times while drinking the local delicacy:
    ogre's brew. Occasionally, hunters will gather to hunt giants or ogres in the mountains.
